## Core Positioning Frameworks

### Framework 1: Positioning Anchors (The Fletch Method)

**Positioning anchors** are reference points that help an audience mentally classify what a product is using familiar concepts. By grounding the unfamiliar in the familiar, positioning anchors establish the baseline context necessary for a value-based conversation to occur.

#### Type 1: Primary Anchors (Sufficient Definition)

Primary anchors provide a **sufficient definition** of the product **in isolation** that lets someone mentally classify what your product is. When a customer asks "what is your product?", primary anchors provide sufficient context.

| Primary Anchor | Definition | Example | Customer Response |
|----------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Activity** | Manual task the product replaces (no category exists yet) | "Loom is a way to record yourself" | "I get it!" |
| **Product Category** | Known software category | "Attio is a CRM" | "I get it!" |
| **Use Case** | Specific task + friction removed | "Calendly is for scheduling meetings over email" | "I get it!" |
| **Competitive Alternative** | Specific tool you replace | "Slack is an email-replacement" | "I get it!" |

**Activity vs Use Case distinction:** Activity positioning names the raw task ("record yourself") without specifying the friction it removes. Use Case positioning names the task AND the problem ("schedule meetings over email" — the problem is the back-and-forth). Activity works when no software category exists yet and buyers don't even have language for the problem. Use Case works when buyers recognize the friction but haven't found a dedicated solution.

**Primary anchors are not optional.** They are the cognitive entry point that enables all downstream messaging about benefits, differentiation, or ROI.

#### Type 2: Secondary Anchors (Descriptive Context)

Secondary anchors provide **descriptive context** that helps clarify or enrich the positioning, but **doesn't classify what the product is** on their own. When used alone, customers still ask "but what is it?"

| Secondary Anchor | Definition | Example (Insufficient) | Customer Response |
|------------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Company Type** | Business segment | "Slack is for small businesses" | "but what is it?" |
| **Department** | Team or role | "Attio is for salespeople" | "but what is it?" |
| **Desired Outcome** | Benefit or result | "Calendly saves you time" | "but what is it?" |

**Critical insight:** Stacking secondary anchors is still inadequate. "Attio helps salespeople in small businesses save time" → Customer: "I still don't get what it is."

#### Combining Primary + Secondary = Maximum Clarity

The most effective positioning combines primary anchors (what it is) with secondary anchors (who it's for, what it does):

**Example: FletchPMM positioning**
> "FletchPMM is a **PMM Consultancy** [Primary: Product Category] that helps **Marketers** [Secondary: Department] in **B2B Software Companies** [Secondary: Company Type] **position their products** [Primary: Use Case]"

| Anchor Combination | Resulting Message |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Category + Persona | "Positioning consultancy for B2B SaaS" |
| Use case + Problem | "Homepage messaging for startups with confusing positioning" |
| Competitive alt + Differentiation | "April Dunford's framework, but with done-for-you execution" |

#### Three Rules for Using Anchors Well

**Rule 1: Choose the right level of clarity (specificity matters)**

| Anchor Type | Vague (Fails) | Specific (Works) |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Activity | "Working" → "we help you work" | "Recording yourself" → "we help you record yourself" |
| Product Category | "Software" → "we are a software company" | "CRM" → "we are a CRM" |
| Use Case | "Running a business" → "we help you run your business" | "Composing an email" → "we help you compose emails" |
| Competitive Alternative | "Traditional tools" → "we replace traditional tools" | "Arc Browser" → "we're an Arc Browser-replacement" |

**Rule 2: Choosing an anchor is (indirectly) choosing a market segment**

| Anchor Choice | Market Segment | Tradeoff |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Competitive Alt: "We are a Clay-alternative" | Appeals to market aware of Clay | Doesn't appeal to market that doesn't know Clay |
| Use Case: "We are a way to enrich your CRM" | Appeals to market wanting to do a task | Potentially not including Clay |

**Rule 3: Layer anchors strategically to create a more specific ICP**

Each additional anchor narrows your target:
- "People updating their coworkers" [Use Case] → broadest
- "...by having meetings" [Competitive Alternative] → narrower
- "...on a sales team" [Department] → narrower still
- "...in small businesses" [Company Type] → most specific ICP

---

### Framework 2: Unique Value (Problem + Differentiation)

**Unique Value = Customer's Problem + Your Differentiated Way of Solving It**

To articulate unique value, you need to **link a key problem to one of your primary anchors**:

| Primary Anchor | Problem Link | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Activity | Problem with doing it manually | "Recording a Loom is way faster than writing long emails to explain things" |
| Product Category | Problem with the category | "CDPs are inflexible & lead to vendor lock-in" |
| Competitive Alternative | Problem with the alternative | "LinkedIn's Inbox is annoying & slow to use" |
| Use Case | Problem with accomplishing the task | "Getting SOC 2 compliant is incredibly time-consuming" |

**The formula:** [Primary Anchor] + [Problem with that anchor] + [Your differentiated solution]

---

### Framework 3: The Binary Positioning Choice (Category vs Problem)

Every B2B product must choose one of two fundamental strategies:

**Strategy A: Category positioning**
- Position within an existing, known category ("shelf")
- Differentiate within that category
- Easier to explain, harder to differentiate
- Best for: Mature markets, known problems

**Strategy B: Problem/use-case positioning**
- Position around a specific workflow or job-to-be-done
- Create differentiation through focus
- Harder to explain, easier to differentiate
- Best for: Emerging markets, new approaches

**The key insight:** Both strategies can work, but they have different tradeoffs. You must consciously choose one as your primary approach.

---

### Framework 4: Three Founder Positioning Types

After working with 350+ startups, Fletch identified three founder types — each requiring a different positioning approach:

**1. Customer-focused founders**
- Dead set on helping a specific group of people (often from their industry)
- Deep insight into customer struggles
- **Approach:** Start with target audience → map workflows → identify competitive alternatives → layer on differentiation

**2. Technology-focused founders**
- Dead set on applying a technology breakthrough (often AI)
- Endless market applications, no strong ICP conviction
- **Approach:** Start with unique product capabilities → work backwards to spotlight weak competitive alternatives → map who uses those alternatives

**3. Competition-focused founders**
- Dead set on disrupting a specific market category
- Direct experience with incumbent products' problems
- **Approach:** Start with competitive alternative → document its weaknesses → position directly against it

---

### Framework 5: The Homepage Clarity Test

Your hero section must answer ONE of these two questions:

1. **"Which of my tools does this replace?"** → Category-based clarity
2. **"Which tasks in my job would this help me with?"** → Problem-based clarity

**The 5-second test:**

- Read only H1 + H2 of any homepage
- If you can't answer one of these questions, the positioning is unclear
- "Platform" alone never passes this test

**What passes:**
- "Salesforce = CRM" (category)
- "Gong = Call Recording" (category)
- "Notion = All-in-one workspace for docs, wikis, and projects" (task)

**What fails:**
- "The platform for modern teams"
- "Unlock your potential with AI"
- "Enterprise-grade solutions"

---

### Framework 6: Competitive Alternatives Matrix

Before positioning, map all alternatives buyers consider:

| Alternative Type | Example | How to Position Against |
|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Manual/DIY** | Spreadsheets, email | Speed, accuracy, scale |
| **Legacy incumbent** | Salesforce, SAP | Modern UX, faster implementation |
| **Direct competitor** | Same-category startup | Feature superiority, focus |
| **Adjacent tool** | Tool that partially solves | Depth, specialization |
| **Status quo** | Doing nothing | Cost of inaction |

---

### Framework 7: Niche Market Positioning

**The $100M niche reality:**
- $1,000 ACV → 100,000 customers needed
- $10,000 ACV → 10,000 customers needed
- $100,000 ACV → 1,000 customers needed

**Five focus strategies for niche positioning:**
1. **One persona** — "CRM for recruiters"
2. **One ecosystem** — "Analytics for Shopify"
3. **One use case** — "Contract review automation"
4. **One industry** — "ERP for construction"
5. **One attribute** — "The fastest [category]"

**When niching is NOT required:**
1. You're in a winner-take-all market with network effects
2. You have massive funding to outspend on awareness
3. Category is so nascent you need to educate broadly
4. You're doing M&A strategy (buying niches vs building)
5. Product is truly horizontal (like Slack, Zoom)

---

### Framework 8: Category Entry Strategies

**For mature categories:**
1. Don't pitch as if you're first — acknowledge the category leader
2. Differentiation must be INSTANTLY apparent
3. Add a modifier to known category (like "smartphone") — don't coin new terms
4. Never say "Intelligent [Category] Management" — stay on the known shelf

**For emerging categories:**
- Link to adjacent known categories
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Use analogies sparingly and only when helpful

---

### Framework 9: The Differentiation Test

**Business outcomes alone don't differentiate:**
> "Every B2B service or product is already assumed to help someone make more money, save money, or save time. Saying those magic words doesn't differentiate you."

**What differentiates:**
1. **Unique delivery mechanism** — HOW you deliver results
2. **Guarantees** — Willing to put money where mouth is
3. **Focus** — Specificity that competitors can't/won't match
4. **Proprietary asset** — Data, technology, or methodology

**The guarantee test:**
> "Are you willing to guarantee the outcome? If not, you want prospects to feel like results are guaranteed without you being willing to guarantee them."

---

### Framework 10: Emerging Market Positioning

For products creating new categories or in nascent markets:

**The dual strategy requirement:**

New markets require TWO different positioning strategies running in parallel:

1. **Product positioning** — For people already in the emerging market
   - Explains why you're the best solution in the category
   - Goal: Pull prospects into your pipeline

2. **Market education** — For people not yet in the market
   - Educates on why this approach matters
   - Goal: Pull prospects into the market itself

**Key insight:** You cannot use ONE message for both audiences. The in-market audience needs differentiation; the out-of-market audience needs education first.

---

### Framework 11: Multi-Product Homepage Strategies

Three approaches for multi-product companies:

**1. Lead with flagship**
- Feature one product prominently in hero
- Secondary products below fold
- Best when: One product drives majority of revenue

**2. Unified umbrella**
- Position the suite/platform as the product
- Individual products as features
- Best when: Cross-sell is primary motion

**3. Segment by persona**
- Different entry points for different buyers
- Navigation-first approach
- Best when: Products serve distinct ICPs

---

### Framework 12: Validating New Positioning

For sales-led startups:

1. **Create positioning hypothesis** — Document current vs. proposed
2. **Test in sales conversations** — A/B test messaging in discovery calls
3. **Track conversion changes** — Demo-to-close rate
4. **Gather objection data** — What new objections emerge?
5. **Iterate before website** — Website is expensive to change

---

### Framework 13: Anchor Selection Decision Tree

A top-down sequential test for rapid anchor orientation before detailed scoring in Phase 2.

**Step 0: Leader Dominance Test**
→ Is there a single dominant leader owning 40%+ of buyer mindshare?
→ Do you have a clear wedge against that leader?
→ IF YES to both → Start with **Competitive Alternative** anchor

**Step 1: Category Awareness Test**
→ When prospects describe what they need, do they use a known category name?
→ Do they Google a specific software category, compare vendors on G2/Capterra?
→ IF YES → Start with **Product Category** anchor

**Step 2: Problem Articulation Test**
→ Can prospects describe the specific friction/pain they experience?
→ Do they have language for the problem, just not for the solution category?
→ IF YES → Start with **Use Case** anchor

**Step 3: Manual Behavior Test**
→ Are prospects solving this with manual work (spreadsheets, email, meetings)?
→ Is there no established software category for this task?
→ IF YES → Start with **Activity** anchor

**Market maturity alignment:**

| Anchor | Market Maturity | Buyer Awareness | Typical Alternative |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Activity | Pre-market | Low — no category language | Manual/DIY processes |
| Use Case | Emerging | Medium — problem language, no category | Broken workflows, workarounds |
| Product Category | Established | High — category language exists | Direct competitors |
| Competitive Alternative | Mature | Very high — dominant leader exists | Named market leader |

**Important:** This tree produces a hypothesis, not a final answer. The detailed anchor scoring in Step 2.4 validates or overrides this initial read.

---

### Framework 14: Secondary Angle Archetypes

After selecting a primary anchor, choose a secondary angle that sharpens differentiation. Select a maximum of 2.

| Angle Archetype | Formula | Example | When It Works |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Niche Down** | "[Primary anchor] built for [specific segment]" | "CRM built for recruiters" | ICP is sharply defined, generalists fail them |
| **Low-Cost Player** | "[Primary anchor] without [expensive pain]" | "CDP without enterprise pricing" | Incumbents are overpriced for segment |
| **Premium Player** | "The most advanced [primary anchor]" | "The most advanced sales engagement platform" | Buyers will pay for best-in-class |
| **Unique Attribute** | "Only [primary anchor] with [exclusive capability]" | "Only CRM with native WhatsApp" | You have a genuinely exclusive feature |
| **Lite Version** | "A lightweight way to [primary anchor activity]" | "A lightweight way to manage contracts" | Existing tools are bloated for use case |

**Relationship to Framework 9 (Differentiation Test):**
- Framework 14 selects the ANGLE (what type of positioning play)
- Framework 9 validates the EVIDENCE (is it defensible?)

---

### Framework 15: Proof Type Mapping per Anchor

Each primary anchor type demands a different evidence strategy.

| Primary Anchor | Best Proof Type | What It Demonstrates | Example |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Activity** | Before → After transformation | Life before software vs. after | "Teams spent 4hrs/week on manual reports. Now it's automated in 10 minutes." |
| **Use Case** | Workflow power + Outcome proof | End-to-end capability AND measurable result | "Cut contract review from 2 hours to 10 minutes with 95% accuracy." |
| **Product Category** | Comparative proof | Head-to-head advantage over category peers | "3x faster implementation than Salesforce, same feature depth." |
| **Competitive Alternative** | Switch & Upgrade proof | Migration story + what they gained | "Switched from [Leader] in 2 weeks. Gained [capability] they didn't have." |

---

## Process (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Discovery & Current State

**Purpose:** Gather raw material and assess current positioning clarity.

**Steps:**

1. **Step 1.1: Fetch website content**
   - Homepage: Extract hero (H1 + H2), value props, feature sections
   - Pricing page: Understand tiers and positioning signals
   - About page: Company context, mission, founding story
   - Product/features page: Capability claims
   - **Output:** Raw content from 4+ pages with URLs

2. **Step 1.2: Apply 5-second clarity test**
   - Read ONLY the hero section (H1 + H2)
   - Does it answer: "Which tools does this replace?" OR "Which tasks does this help with?"
   - Score: Pass/Fail with specific rationale
   - **Output:** Clarity test result

3. **Step 1.3: Identify founder type**
   - Ask or infer: Customer-focused, Technology-focused, or Competition-focused?
   - This determines the positioning approach sequence
   - **Output:** Founder type classification

4. **Step 1.4: Extract current positioning elements**
   - What category do they claim? (explicit or implied)
   - What differentiation do they claim?
   - Who do they say they serve?
   - What problem do they claim to solve?
   - **Output:** Current positioning summary

**Phase 1 Checkpoint:**

- [ ] Website content fetched (4+ pages)
- [ ] 5-second test completed with pass/fail
- [ ] Founder type identified
- [ ] Current positioning extracted

### Phase 2: Anchor & Alternative Mapping

**Purpose:** Map positioning anchors and competitive alternatives.

**Steps:**

1. **Step 2.1: Map potential positioning anchors**
   - Activity anchors (what manual work do they replace? No category exists yet?)
   - Product category anchors (what shelf could they be on?)
   - Use case/workflow anchors (what tasks do they enable, what friction do they remove?)
   - Problem anchors (what pain do they solve?)
   - Persona anchors (who specifically do they serve?)
   - Competitive alternative anchors (what do they replace?)
   - **Output:** Anchor options matrix (6 types x 2-3 options each)

2. **Step 2.2: Map competitive alternatives**
   - Manual/DIY: How do prospects solve this without software?
   - Legacy incumbent: Who's the "Salesforce" of this space?
   - Direct competitors: Same-category startups
   - Adjacent tools: Partial solutions from other categories
   - Status quo: What happens if they do nothing?
   - **Output:** Competitive alternatives matrix with positioning angles

3. **Step 2.3: Run anchor selection decision tree (quick diagnostic)**
   - Run the Esner Decision Tree (Framework 13) sequentially
   - Record the hypothesis anchor type
   - This hypothesis will be validated or overridden by the scoring matrix in Step 2.4
   - **Output:** Initial anchor hypothesis with reasoning

4. **Step 2.4: Score anchor combinations**
   - For each primary + secondary anchor combination:
     - Clarity score (1-5): How easy to understand?
     - Differentiation score (1-5): How distinct from alternatives?
     - Relevance score (1-5): Does this anchor matter to the buyer's current priorities?
   - **Output:** Ranked anchor combinations

5. **Step 2.5: Assess market maturity**
   - Emerging market: Needs dual strategy (product + education)
   - Mature market: Needs clear differentiation against known alternatives
   - **Output:** Market maturity classification

**Phase 2 Checkpoint:**

- [ ] 6 anchor types mapped with options
- [ ] Competitive alternatives documented
- [ ] Anchor selection hypothesis recorded (decision tree)
- [ ] Anchor combinations scored
- [ ] Market maturity assessed

### Phase 3: Strategy Selection

**Purpose:** Make the key positioning decisions.

**Steps:**

1. **Step 3.1: Select binary strategy**
   - Category positioning OR Problem/use-case positioning
   - Document rationale based on market maturity and founder type
   - **Output:** Primary strategy with reasoning

2. **Step 3.2: Select primary anchor, secondary anchor, and secondary angle**
   - Primary anchor: Main reference point from Framework 1 (drives H1)
   - Secondary anchor: Supporting context from Framework 1 (drives H2)
   - Secondary angle archetype: Differentiation type from Framework 14 — max 2
   - Validate decision tree hypothesis against scoring results
   - **Output:** Anchor pair + angle archetype selection with rationale

3. **Step 3.3: Define differentiators**
   - NOT business outcomes alone (those are table stakes)
   - Focus on: Unique delivery mechanism, guarantees, focus, proprietary assets
   - Test: Would you guarantee this outcome?
   - **Output:** 2-3 defensible differentiators

4. **Step 3.4: Determine market focus**
   - Broad vs. niche assessment
   - If niche, select focus strategy: persona, ecosystem, use case, industry, or attribute
   - TAM reality check: At target ACV, how many customers needed?
   - **Output:** Market focus decision with TAM math

5. **Step 3.5: Select primary competitive alternative**
   - Which alternative will you primarily position against?
   - This shapes all messaging angles
   - **Output:** Primary competitive alternative

6. **Step 3.6: Run clarity ladder**
   - Test whether positioning compresses cleanly at four levels:
     - One word: Does a single word capture the essence?
     - One phrase: Is the phrase differentiated?
     - One sentence: Does it pass the 5-second clarity test?
     - One paragraph: Does the full statement answer all buyer questions?
   - If any level fails, revisit anchor or differentiator selection
   - **Output:** Clarity ladder table (4 rows)

7. **Step 3.7: Run guarantee test on all differentiators**
   - For each differentiator:
     - Would you guarantee this outcome with money on the line?
     - What evidence supports it?
     - Verdict: Pass / Fail / Partial (with conditions)
   - Cross-reference proof type: Does evidence match the recommended proof type for your primary anchor? (See Framework 15)
   - **Output:** Guarantee test table

8. **Step 3.8: Map strategic implications**
   - For each strategy decision, document what it implies for:
     - Messaging direction (what to lead with, what to avoid)
     - ICP sharpening (which segments to prioritize based on anchor choices)
     - Competitive counter-positions (per-competitor response)
   - **Output:** Implications table

**Phase 3 Checkpoint:**

- [ ] Binary strategy selected (category vs. problem)
- [ ] Primary + secondary anchors chosen
- [ ] Secondary angle archetype selected (Framework 14)
- [ ] Decision tree hypothesis confirmed or overridden
- [ ] Differentiators defined (not just outcomes)
- [ ] Market focus determined with TAM check
- [ ] Primary competitive alternative selected
- [ ] Clarity ladder passes at all levels
- [ ] All differentiators pass guarantee test (or flagged as partial/fail)
- [ ] Proof types aligned to primary anchor (Framework 15)
- [ ] Strategic implications mapped for downstream skills

|----------------|-------------------|
| Activity | "We help [persona] [do activity] — replacing [manual process] with [product mechanism]." |
| Use Case | "We help [persona] [accomplish use case] without [key friction] — by [differentiated approach]." |
| Product Category | "We are a [category] that [key differentiator] — unlike [competitive alternative] which [weakness]." |
| Competitive Alternative | "We're a [leader]-alternative that [key upgrade] — for [persona] who [unmet need]." |

**One-sentence positioning (external use):**

> "[Statement using template above, compressed to one sentence]"

### Guarantee test

| Differentiator | Evidence | Proof Type Match | Verdict |
|----------------|----------|------------------|---------|
| [Differentiator 1] | [Evidence] | [Aligned / Misaligned] | Pass / Fail / Partial |

### Strategic implications

| Dimension | Implication | How to apply |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Messaging | [What to lead with, what to avoid] | [Direction for product-messaging] |
| ICP | [Which segments to prioritize] | [Direction for icp-research] |
| Competitive | [Per-competitor counter-positions] | [Direction for sales-enablement] |

### Channel emphasis guidance

| Channel / Context | Typical Emphasis | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| Homepage hero | Primary anchor (clearest classification) | Category or Use Case statement |
| Thought leadership / LinkedIn | Activity or Use Case (problem education) | "Most teams still do X manually..." |
| Comparison pages / G2 | Competitive Alternative (direct positioning) | "Unlike [Leader], we..." |
| Sales discovery calls | Use Case or Activity (pain exploration) | "How are you currently handling X?" |
| Case studies | Proof type matching primary anchor | Before/After, Switch story, etc. |

---

## Validation recommendations

| Test | Method | Success Metric |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Sales conversation test | A/B test messaging in discovery calls | Demo-to-close rate |
| Homepage A/B test | Test new hero vs. current | Scroll depth, CTA clicks |
| Customer recognition | Ask customers "what do we do?" | Consistent answers |

---

## Next steps

- [ ] Test positioning in 5-10 sales conversations before website changes
- [ ] Run `product-messaging` skill with this positioning as input
- [ ] Run `landing-page-copy` skill for full page copy
- [ ] Align team on one-liner (which version for which context)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| "Platform for X" alone | Doesn't explain what it does | Add what the platform enables |
| "AI-powered" as differentiator | Everyone says this now | Focus on outcome AI enables |
| "Best in class" | Unsubstantiated claim | Specific, provable differentiator |
| Listing 10+ use cases | Confuses, doesn't position | Lead with 1-2, expand later |
| New category coining | Moves you off known shelf | Modifier on known category |
| Business outcome only | Table stakes, not differentiator | HOW you deliver the outcome |

---

## Self-Evaluation Protocol

After generating positioning output, automatically run these checks:

### Completeness Check
- [ ] All 3 phases complete (Discovery, Anchors, Strategy)?
- [ ] Anchor decision tree hypothesis recorded and validated against scoring?
- [ ] Secondary angle archetype selected (Framework 14)?
- [ ] Clarity ladder passes at all four levels?
- [ ] Strategic implications mapped?

### Evidence Quality Check
- [ ] Differentiators are defensible (not just outcomes)?
- [ ] All differentiators have formal guarantee test verdicts?
- [ ] Proof types aligned to primary anchor (Framework 15)?
- [ ] Competitive alternatives based on actual market research?
- [ ] Market focus TAM math is realistic?

### Guardrail Check
- [ ] No "platform for X" without explaining what platform enables?
- [ ] No invented category names?
- [ ] No "AI-powered" as primary differentiator?
- [ ] No business outcomes alone as differentiation?
- [ ] No more than 3 differentiators (focus)?

### Self-Roast Questions

1. "If Anthony Pierri reviewed this, what would he flag as lazy positioning?"
2. "Does the 5-second test really pass, or am I being generous?"
3. "Are these differentiators truly unique, or could any competitor claim them?"
4. "Would a prospect immediately understand what this product replaces?"
5. "Is the market focus decision backed by real TAM math or hopeful thinking?"
